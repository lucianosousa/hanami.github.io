<p>Hello wonderful community!</p>

<p>We would like to improve our documentation in October and we need your help. 🙌</p>

<p>Make a contribution to the <a href="http://hanamirb.org/guides/">Hanami guides</a> in the following repository: <a href="https://github.com/hanami/hanami.github.io">https://github.com/hanami/hanami.github.io</a>.</p>

<p>Every contribution will be awarded with new (and improved) Hanami stickers. Very eager contributors will receive larger gadgets, such as t-shirts.</p>

<p>Do you need some inspiration? Maybe have a look at <a href="https://github.com/hanami/hanami.github.io/issues">these ideas</a>, or write about repositories, and validations.</p>

<p>We appreciate every contribution ❤️.</p>
